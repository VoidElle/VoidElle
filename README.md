# I'm Luca Del Corona (he/him) :wave:

My name is Luca Del Corona. I'm a high school student at ITI Galileo Galilei in Leghorn, Italy. I started my journey with web development, doing some basic HTML - CSS - Javascript. Then i started to learn Java with the purpose to write some Minecraft's plugins, and after making some basics things i discovered how big is the world of developers. Right now I'm currently learning mobile development creating some project (Making also the backend).
All of my public projects can be found in my Github profile.

I spend my free time riding my bike and listening to music. I'm currently planning to expand my garage :)
